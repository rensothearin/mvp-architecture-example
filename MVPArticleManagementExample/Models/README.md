###  Model
----------------------------------
The *model* is an interface defining the data to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the user interface.
Think of a *model* like a table in your database. *Model* here represents of your table. You can create *model* using *structure* or *class* as you prefer, but for recommendation you should use *class* to create the model since *class* has inheritance feature that you can extend your model in later version of your application.
